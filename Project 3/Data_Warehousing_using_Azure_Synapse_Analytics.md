# 3 Data Warehousing using Azure Synapse Analytics
- Build a data warehousing solution with Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse).
- Integrate data from various sources, implement schema design, and optimize queries for analytics and reporting.

### Dataset: [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Select large and diverse datasets to populate a data warehouse, such as financial, e-commerce, or social media data.

## Brief Execution Steps
### Getting Started
1. **Provision Synapse Analytics:** Create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace in the Azure Portal.
2. **Define Source Data:** Identify and prepare datasets to be loaded into the data warehouse.

### Execution Steps
1. **Data Ingestion:** Use Azure Data Factory or PolyBase to ingest data from various sources into Synapse.
2. **Schema Design:** Design and create data tables and schema within Synapse Analytics.
3. **Data Transformation:** Perform ETL operations using SQL or Spark within Synapse Studio to cleanse and transform data.
4. **Query and Analysis:** Write SQL queries or Spark scripts to analyze and derive insights from the data.

## Detailed Execution Steps
### 1. Getting Started
- **Provision Synapse Analytics:** Create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace in the Azure Portal.
- **Define Source Data:** Identify and prepare datasets to be loaded into the data warehouse.

### 2. Execution Steps
- **Step 1: Data Ingestion**
    - **Connect Data Sources:** Ingest data from various sources (Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, etc.) using Azure Data Factory or PolyBase.
    - **Data Loading:** Load data into dedicated SQL pools or serverless SQL pools within Synapse Analytics.
- **Step 2: Schema Design and Data Transformation**
    - **Schema Definition:** Design data tables and schemas within Synapse Analytics based on the loaded data.
    - **Data Transformation:** Perform ETL operations using SQL scripts or dedicated tools within Synapse Studio.
- **Step 3: Query and Analysis**
    - **SQL Queries:** Write SQL queries to query and analyze data within Synapse Analytics for reporting and insights.
    - **Visualization:** Visualize data using Power BI or Azure Synapse Studio's built-in visualization capabilities.
