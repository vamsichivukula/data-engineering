# 6. Machine Learning Pipelines using Azure Machine Learning
- Create end-to-end machine learning pipelines using Azure Machine Learning service.
- Preprocess data, train models, and deploy them as web services for predictions or inferences.

### Dataset: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- Diverse datasets for supervised/unsupervised learning tasks suitable for building ML models.

## Brief Execution Steps
### Getting Started
1. **Create Azure Functions App:** Set up an Azure Functions App in the Azure Portal.
2. **Define Triggers and Inputs:** Define triggers (HTTP, Timer, etc.) and input sources for the functions.

### Execution Steps
1. **Function Development:** Write code/logic for serverless functions in supported languages (Python, C#, etc.).
2. **Test Locally:** Test functions locally before deploying them to Azure.
3. **Deploy Functions:** Publish functions to the Azure Functions App and configure triggers and bindings.
4. **Monitoring and Debugging:** Monitor function execution, handle exceptions, and debug using Azure Monitor or Application Insights.

### How to Execute
1. **Azure Portal:** Create required resources (Data Lake Storage, Functions App) and manage configurations via the Azure Portal.
2. **Azure Documentation and Samples:** Refer to official Azure documentation and GitHub repositories for code samples, guides, and best practices for each service.
3. **Hands-on Labs and Workshops:** Participate in Azure hands-on labs or workshops provided by Microsoft or third-party training platforms.

### Additional Considerations
- **Automation and Integration:** Explore integrating Azure services for seamless data workflows and automation.
- **Cost Management:** Optimize costs by scaling resources as needed and leveraging Azure's cost management tools for monitoring usage.

Implementing these projects involves a mix of configuring services, writing code/logic, managing data, and monitoring executions. Utilize Azure's resources, tutorials, and sample codes to build these solutions effectively. Tailor each project according to your learning objectives and desired outcomes.

## Detailed Execution Steps
### 1. Getting Started
- **Create Azure Functions App:** Access the Azure Portal and create an Azure Functions App.
- **Define Triggers and Inputs:** Determine the triggers (HTTP, Timer, etc.) and inputs required for the functions.

### 2. Execution Steps
- **Step 1: Function Development**
    - **Language and Environment:** Choose a supported language (such as Python, C#, JavaScript) for developing Azure Functions.
    - **Code Logic:** Write the code/logic for serverless functions that perform data processing tasks (e.g., data transformation, validation, enrichment.
- **Step 2: Testing Locally**
    - **Local Development:** Use Azure Functions Core Tools or Visual Studio Code with Azure Functions extension to test functions locally.
    - **Unit Testing:** Perform unit testing of functions to ensure they perform the intended tasks.
- **Step 3: Deploy Functions**
    - **Publish Functions:** Publish the developed functions to the Azure Functions App created earlier.
    - **Configure Triggers and Bindings:** Configure triggers and bindings (input and output connections) for the deployed functions.
- **Step 4: Monitoring and Debugging**
    - **Azure Portal Monitoring:** Monitor function execution, logs, and performance metrics via the Azure Portal.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling and debugging mechanisms for effective troubleshooting.

### How to Execute
1. **Azure Portal and Visual Studio Code:** Create and manage Azure Functions resources, code, and configurations via the Azure Portal and Visual Studio Code.
2. **Azure Functions Documentation:** Refer to Azure Functions documentation and GitHub repositories for sample codes, guides, and best practices.
3. **Hands-on Labs and Workshops:** Participate in Azure Functions workshops or labs available on Microsoft Learn or other learning platforms.

### Additional Considerations
- **Integration and Triggers:** Explore integrating Azure Functions with other Azure services (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, Azure Event Grid) for seamless data workflows.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize function performance by configuring scaling settings and utilizing the appropriate function plans.

Executing this project involves creating, developing, deploying, and monitoring serverless functions for data processing tasks. Utilize Azure's resources, documentation, and practical applications to effectively build and execute serverless data processing solutions using Azure Functions.
