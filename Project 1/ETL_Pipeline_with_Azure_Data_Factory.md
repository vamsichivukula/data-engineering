# 1. ETL Pipeline with Azure Data Factory
- Design and implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Azure Data Factory.
- Extract data from diverse sources (CSV, databases, APIs), transform it using Azure Databricks or Azure HDInsight, and load it into Azure SQL Data Warehouse or Azure Cosmos DB.

### Dataset: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- Various datasets covering diverse domains like healthcare, finance, and more, suitable for practicing ETL processes.

## Brief Execution Steps
### Getting Started
1. **Define Requirements:** Outline data sources, transformation logic, and target data storage (Azure SQL Database, Data Lake, etc.).
2. **Azure Portal Setup:** Sign in to Azure Portal and create an Azure Data Factory (ADF) instance.

### Execution Steps
1. **Create Linked Services:** Establish connections to data sources and sinks (Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, etc.) using Linked Services in ADF.
2. **Define Datasets:** Define datasets representing source and destination data structures.
3. **Build Pipelines:** Design pipelines within ADF, incorporating activities like Copy Data, Transform Data, and Execute Stored Procedures.
4. **Monitor and Run:** Monitor pipeline runs, manage triggers or schedules, and execute the ETL pipeline.

## Detailed Execution Steps
### 1. Getting Started
- **Azure Data Factory Setup:** Sign in to Azure Portal and create an Azure Data Factory (ADF) instance.
- **Define Requirements:** Clearly outline data sources, transformation requirements, and target destinations.

### 2. Execution Steps
- **Step 1: Create Linked Services**
    - **Define Connections:** Set up linked services to connect to source and destination data stores (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, etc.) within ADF.
    - **Authentication:** Configure authentication details (e.g., keys, secrets) required to access the data stores.
- **Step 2: Define Datasets**
    - **Source and Sink Definitions:** Define datasets representing source and destination data structures.
    - **Schema Mapping:** Define schema details, file formats, and mappings between source and sink datasets.
- **Step 3: Build Pipelines**
    - **Activities Configuration:** Design pipelines using ADF's visual interface, incorporating activities like Copy Data, Execute Stored Procedures, Transform Data using Azure Databricks, or custom activities via Azure Batch or Azure Functions.
    - **Sequencing and Dependencies:** Configure activity sequences, dependencies, and triggers for orchestrated execution.
- **Step 4: Monitor and Run Pipelines**
    - **Pipeline Validation:** Validate pipelines for errors or misconfigurations using ADF's monitoring and validation tools.
    - **Run Pipelines:** Trigger pipeline runs manually or schedule them based on a predefined schedule or event trigger.

### Advanced Steps (Optional)
- **Data Transformation using Azure Databricks:** Utilize Azure Databricks to perform complex transformations, machine learning, or big data processing within the ETL pipeline.
- **Error Handling and Retry Logic:** Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for fault tolerance in case of data pipeline failures.

### Execution Tips
- **Documentation and Samples:** Refer to Azure Data Factory documentation, tutorials, and GitHub repositories for sample pipelines and detailed step-by-step guides.
- **Incremental Development:** Start with smaller pipeline components, gradually expanding and optimizing the ETL workflow.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor pipeline execution metrics and performance to optimize data transfer and processing.

Azure Data Factory offers a graphical interface for designing, monitoring, and managing ETL pipelines. Understanding data movement, transformations, and workflow orchestration concepts within ADF will be crucial in effectively executing this project. Exploring and experimenting within the Azure Data Factory interface will significantly enhance your proficiency in building robust ETL solutions on Azure.
