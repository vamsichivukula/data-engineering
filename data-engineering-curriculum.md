# Kaggle Projects

Certainly! Kaggle hosts a variety of datasets and competitions that can help you practice and showcase your skills as a Data Engineer. Here are some project ideas and Kaggle competitions suited for Data Engineering:

### Kaggle Project Ideas:

#### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Work on datasets with missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies. Perform data cleaning using Pandas to preprocess the data for analysis.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Choose datasets to explore relationships, distributions, and patterns. Create visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn to derive insights.

#### 3. Database Management:
- Design and implement a SQLite or PostgreSQL database for a given dataset. Perform CRUD operations and execute queries using Python.

#### 4. ETL Processes:
- Create an ETL pipeline to extract data from various sources (CSV, JSON, APIs), transform it using Pandas, and load it into a database.

#### 5. Working with Cloud Platforms:
- Use Kaggle's cloud-based environment or AWS/GCP services to analyze datasets or perform specific tasks related to data processing.

### Kaggle Competitions for Data Engineers:

#### 1. [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
