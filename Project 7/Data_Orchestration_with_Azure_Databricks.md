# 7. Data Orchestration with Azure Databricks
- Utilize Azure Databricks to orchestrate data processing workflows.
- Perform complex data transformations, execute batch or streaming jobs, and visualize insights.

### Dataset: [NASA's Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/)
- Access datasets related to astronomy, space exploration, and satellite imagery to orchestrate complex data workflows.

## Bried Execution Steps
### Getting Started
1. **Provision Azure Databricks Workspace:** Create an Azure Databricks workspace in the Azure Portal.
2. **Define Data Sources:** Identify data sources to be processed and analyzed using Azure Databricks.

### Execution Steps
1. **Cluster Configuration:** Set up and configure clusters in Azure Databricks for data processing.
2. **Notebook Development:** Create and execute Databricks notebooks using languages like Python, SQL, or Scala for data transformations, analytics, and visualization.
3. **Job Scheduling:** Schedule jobs to automate notebook execution at specific intervals using Databricks Jobs.

## Detailed Execution Steps
### 1. Getting Started
- **Create Azure Databricks Workspace:** Access the Azure Portal and create an Azure Databricks workspace.
