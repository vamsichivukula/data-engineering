# 4. Serverless Data Processing with Azure Functions
- Implement serverless functions for specific data processing tasks like data validation, enrichment, or aggregation.
- Trigger functions based on events or schedules to perform data processing operations.

### Dataset: Generate Synthetic Data
- Create artificial datasets with libraries like Faker or generate sample data using Python for testing serverless functions.

## Brief Exectuion Steps
### Getting Started
1. **Setup Azure Machine Learning Workspace:** Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure Portal.
2. **Data Preparation:** Select datasets suitable for training and testing ML models.

### Execution Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, preprocess, and feature engineer the data using Python or Azure ML Data Prep SDK.
2. **Model Training:** Utilize Azure ML to create and train machine learning models using algorithms like regression, classification, or clustering.
3. **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model as a web service or container for inference using Azure ML Service.
4. **Model Monitoring:** Monitor model performance, track predictions, and retrain models as needed.

### How to Execute
1. **Azure Portal:** Create the necessary resources (Synapse Analytics workspace, Machine Learning workspace) through the Azure Portal.
2. **Azure Documentation and Tutorials:** Refer to Azure's official documentation and tutorials for detailed guidance on each service and its functionalities.
3. **Sample Codes and Notebooks:** Explore sample codes, Jupyter notebooks, and templates available in Azure documentation or GitHub repositories for practical implementation.

### Additional Tips
- **Learning Paths:** Follow Azure learning paths available on Microsoft Learn to gain step-by-step guidance on using Azure services for specific use cases.
- **Community Engagement:** Participate in Azure forums, discussions, and communities to seek advice, share experiences, and troubleshoot issues.
